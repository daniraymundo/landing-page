# About
<p> This is my second project as part of The Odin Project's Foundations Course. </p>
<p> The task is to create an entire landing page from scratch in HTML and CSS using a provided design as reference. </p>
<p> I applied what I learned about the Flexbox layout to try to copy it as closely as possible, focusing on the alignment and placement of the different elements. </p>
<p> The part I struggled with the most is keeping the position and sizes of the flex elements and spaces fixed when zooming in and out of the page, especially when using "justify-content: space between". Turns out the fix is super simple: set a max-width for the containers so the elements don't expand indefinitely! My problem solving skills were definitely tested with this one but I learned a lot and I'm looking forward to building more stuff!</p>

# Live Preview
View my landing page output <a href="https://daniraymundo.github.io/landing-page/">here</a>.
<p><strong>I've noticed that this only looks fine when viewing at around 67% zoom or less in most browsers. I have yet to learn about responsive web design and using the right units. I'll revisit this once I do, but that's the workaround for now.</strong></p>
