# About
<p> This is my second project as part of The Odin Project's Foundations Course. </p>
<p> The task is to create an entire landing page from scratch in HTML and CSS using a provided design as reference. </p>
<p> I applied what I learned about the Flexbox layout to try to copy it as closely as possible, focusing on the alignment and placement of the different elements. </p>
<p> The part I struggled with the most is keeping the position and sizes of the flex elements and spaces fixed when zooming in and out of the page, especially when using "justify-content: space between". Turns out the fix is super simple: set a max-width for the containers so the elements don't expand indefinitely! My problem solving skills were definitely tested with this one but I learned a lot and I'm looking forward to building more stuff!</p>
