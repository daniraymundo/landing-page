# Landing Page
<p> This is my second project as part of The Odin Project's Foundations Course. </p>
<p> The task is to create an entire landing page from scratch using a provided design as reference. </p>
<p> <a href="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png" alt="landing page template">This</a> is the reference image. I applied what I learned about the Flexbox layout to try to mimic it as closely as possible, focusing on the alignment and placement of the different elements. </p>
